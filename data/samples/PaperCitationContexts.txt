1552	3187946	RESULTS AND DISCUSION In a previous paper [9] it was shown that the loss of the mineral phase (hydroxyapatite) helps to reduce the thermal stability of the collagen macromolecule due to the loss of interaction between hydroxyapatite crystals and collagen matrix of bone.
1552	1970071418	Moreover, as already mentioned in the introduction, previous studies [8] showed that by deforming the bone collagen, which possesses piezoelectric properties [10], is generated, according to Wolf's Law, a charge separation that can stimulate mineral deposition in the area under compression (convex) but not in the area subjected to tension (concave).
1552	1976727071	Although poorly described as nucleating sites [15], Landis and Silver [16] argue that in such spaces favorable conditions are present not only for nucleation but also influencing the size, shape, orientation and alignment, more specifically the stereochemical features presented by these areas of the collagen fibril.
1552	1991414521	Glimcher in 1959 [4] proposes a theory about the calcification of bones based on three concepts: 1) bone matrix is composed mostly of collagen fibers, 2) the initiation of calcification occurs in the ‚Äúhole‚Äù or gaps that occur in the collagen fibrils, 3) the generation of the earliest mineral aggregates (nuclei) occurs with a heterogeneous nucleation process.
1552	1991414521	As seen in the micrograph, those early mineral aggregates (nuclei) occur under a heterogeneous nucleation process described by Glimcher [4], who reported that collagen type I has holes of 64 nm, which seem to favor the nucleation process while tropocollagen by themselves cannot [12].
1552	2001741437	However, Landis and Hodges [6] described the presence of crystal in the hole and superficially, in turkey tendon treated samples, suggesting that mineral nucleation can also occur on the surface, and that is not an exclusive process of the hole.
1552	2038981972	Also found in other studies that the interaction of Ca and P ions with collagen (mediated through specific amino acid residues that form a structural part of the dark bands of collagen fibrils), alter the protein's ability to store elastic energy, which is critical for the maintenance and function of bone [17].
1552	2057649835	collagen is highly oriented and follows a pattern of order, so that the collagen structure provides a collective cohesive response against a mechanical load [13], and this would induce a physiological effect translated or mediated by a piezoelectric effect, which in turn would benefit the deposition of mineral at the surface under compression.
1552	2057649835	Deforming forces in tension or compression generate modifications or changes that result in substantial changes and with specific orientation [13].
1552	2075170423	Marino [7] proposed that bone collagen is piezoelectric and Noris-Suarez et al [8] shows that in a cell free system in the presence of a simulated body fluid, mineral deposition on the surface is promoted when deformed in compression (convex).
1552	2122907545	These factors are of particular interest because bone tissue (and other materials) is particularly viscoelastic [1].
1552	2130329035	Lees and Prostak [14], meanwhile , have demonstrated that the size of the hydroxyapatite crystals exceed the intermolecular spacing in collagen fibrils and describe most of the crystals in bone are located in interfibrillar spaces, coinciding with the results
1552	2150563550	Moreover, Wuthier [11] concluded that repetitive holes observed in the collagen fibers (as seen in Figures 3 and 4) are poor apatite nucleating agents.

1688	1979575715	In such circumstance, Engle [5] showed that it is possible to model the mean and the variance of a series simultaneously by a model named Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH).
1688	1979575715	Engle [5] showed that the serial correlation in squared returns, or conditional heteroskedasticity, can be modeled using an ARCH model.

1688	1988518729	According to Thomason [10], [11] and Tay and Cao [9], this transformation has many advantages.
1688	1988518729	According to Tay and Cao [9] and Thomason [10] [11], the prediction performance is evaluated using the following statistics: Mean Square Error (MSE), Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Directional Symmetry (DS) and Weighted Directional Symmetry (WDS).
1688	1999996900	In latter, Bollerslev [1] extended Engle‚Äôs original work by developing a technique that allows the conditional variance to be an ARMA process and that extended process is known as the GARCH process.

2361	2010449071	According to Tepper (2007) abusive supervision is a serious problem for both employees and employers There are several costs associated with abusive supervision such as: limited employee citizenship behavior, decreased productivity, heightened anxiety, Subordinate's resistance behavior, subordinates aggressive and deviant behavior, psychological distress and overall job and life dissatisfaction( Tepper, 2010).
2361	2140621043	Research indicates that supervisors perform behaviors that can be characterized as bullying (Hoel, Rayner, & Cooper, 1999) tyrannical (Ashforth, 1994), abusive (Keashly, Trott, & MacLean, 1994) or undermining (Duffy, Ganster, & Pagon, 2002).

2678	177260854	During creative thought, memes potentially relevant to a solution would evoke or activate one another, altering or strategically (though not necessarily consciously) manipulating them, a process that is said to involve pattern completion, constraint satisfaction (Rumelhart & McClelland 1986), and the tweaking, blending, redescription, abstraction, and recoding of representations (Hofstadter 1985; Holland et al. 1986; Karmiloff-Smith 1986; 1992; Ram 1993; Clark & Thornton 1995).

2678	1556625939	We now ask: What is the cultural analog to the origin of life? One could say it is the point in history when organisms acquired the capacity for social transmission, but as many authors (e.g. Darwin 1871; Plotkin 1988) have pointed out, although transmission is widespread throughout the animal kingdom, no other species has anything remotely approaching the complexity of human culture.

2678	2033323247	Rather, as Lumsden and Wilson (1981) point out, it builds on this framework, adding that the study of cognition will flounder until we admit that the role of transmission is equally undeniable.
2678	2046917168	This &cultural &momentum could explain why, despite the intuition that individuals control their streams of thought, creators often express surprise at the sudden appearance of an idea, and deny active effort in its immediate creation (Bowers et al 1990; Guilford 1979; Kubose et al 1980; Wallas 1926).

2678	2140361415	One way to defend oneself against painful or manipulative memes is to construct what Dennett (1995) refers to as a ‚Äòmeme-immunological system‚Äô; that is, formulate new memes specifically to deflect ‚Äòmemetic antigens‚Äô.

4365	2101124037	Although they maintained that freedom from fear and freedom from want are the fundamental objectives of human security, they try to define the term more narrowly, in order to increase its analytical and policy value, avoiding models "that can cope with all forms of human interaction simultaneously" [ 74 ], something impossible to achieve.

4461	658650040	According to Aryeetey (2008) during the past two decades the emphasis has been on establishing microfinance schemes as the best alternative to ensuring access to financial services for small borrowers.
4461	658650040	Potential clients normally receive training at the branch prior to formal application for a loan and they are mainly engaged in the informal sector of the economy and predominated by micro-entrepreneurs, majority of whom are not able to access credit from the formal commercial banks as a result of the perceived risks posed by this group of people and the lack of collateral to secure credit facilities granted by these banks (Aryeetey, 1994; Basu et al., 2004).
4461	2005869244	This stems mainly from the belief that providing small loans, savings and insurance products to the poor, and more especially women, could be a way of providing opportunities to be self-reliant and play active roles in their households and communities (Khandker, 2003; Holvoet, 2005).
4461	2034752060	Following from Coleman (1999), this paper models the effect of microfinance intervention on financial capital, human capital and physical capital as follows:
4461	2078993558	At one extreme are studies arguing that microfinance has very beneficial economic, well-being and social impacts (Khandker, 1998; Morduch, 1999).
4461	2078993558	The findings are also consistent with researchers who argue that programmes that have attained financial sustainability provide the most impacts on participants‚Äô standards of living (Hulme and Mosley, 1996; Morduch, 1999).
4461	2082941151	Lack of well-being therefore implies severely curtailed human capabilities (Sen, 1997).
4461	2082941151	Thus, assets are identified as the basis of agents‚Äô power to act to reproduce, challenge or change the rules that govern the control, use and transformation of resources (Sen, 1997).
4461	2889926776	The analysis of assets and their accumulation is aimed at complementing such measures by extending our understanding of the multi-dimensional character of poverty and the complexity of the processes underlying poverty reduction (Schreiner, 2004; Adato et al., 2006).
6071	1800194818	The mechanisms that might explain the negative influence of the low GFR on HF, include peripheral and myocardial hypoxia, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, resistance to erythropoietin, acceleration of left ventricle hypertrophy and dilatation, aberrant ventricular remodelation, salt retention ( Luthi et al 2006 ).
6071	2012781794	In the elderly, the additional myocardial fibrosis, that inevitably occurs, and the diastolic dysfunction are known factors that contribute to the high value of NT-proBNP (Redfield et al 2002;  Galasko et al 2005 ).

7003	2021121347	Here we are adopting Campbell's discussion (1995) concerning the nature of coherence and cohesion because it is clear and practical.
7003	2021121347	For instance, Campbell (1995) has observed that Halliday and Hasan's extensive cohesive ties in discourse analysis is only applicable in analyzing a short text and would be severely restricted in application to any longer text.

Recently, Bridges and Reich introduced the concept of multisymplectic spectral discretizations for Hamiltonian wave equations with periodic boundary conditions [ 5 ].Bridges and Reich [ 5 ] have shown that using the Fourier transforms leaves the multi‚Äìsymplectic nature of a PDE unchanged and that the discrete Fourier system recovers the standard spectral discretizations leading to a system of Hamiltonian ODEs which can be integrated by standard symplectic integrators.gives a multi‚Äìsymplectic spatial discretization [ 5 ].

Initial data (a)and (b)correspond to multi-phase solutions, near the plane wave, which are characterized by either one or two excited modes, respectively.In [ 2 ], a multi-symplectic centered cell discretization (obtained by concatenating two implicit midpoint schemes)as well as an integrable-symplectic discretization (an integrable spatial discretization with symplectic integrator in time)were developed for the NLS equation.S and MS-CC, respectively for initial data (b)with discretization parameters N =6 4 ,‚àÜ t =5 √ó 10 ‚àí3 ,T =0 ‚àí 50. The MS-S scheme correctly captures the quasiperiodic motion and produces results which are comparable to those obtained using the integrable-symplectic scheme (see [ 2 ]).

12071	2112151235	In North American temperate forests with similar vegetation and climate types, the species composition of AM fungi was similar but relative abundance of different species was different, perhaps due to differences in local soil conditions (Klironomos et al. 1993) . EM fungal communities have also been shown to be related to soil factors and dominant tree composition ( Kernaghan et al. 2003 ) .

That difference between population genetic structure of epigeous and hypogeous fungal species reflects a contrast in dispersal modes, whereby epigeous fruiters producing airborne spores can disperse far greater distances than hypogeous species whose dispersal agents are often small mammals with much smaller home ranges (Maser et al. 1978 ;  Meyer ...A variety of organisms have been shown to move viable spores of mycorrhizal fungi at scales ranging from cm to km (e.g., Maser et al. 1978 ;  Meyer et al. 2005 ;  Ashkannejhad and Horton 2006) . Differential dispersal of mycorrhizal species by dispersal agents may lead to patchiness of species distributions in the field as dispersed propagules establish and spread.
12071	2148567746	Experimental studies have shown that plant community composition can affect the composition of mycorrhizal communities at a m 2 scale ( Burrows and Pfleger 2002 ) , so variation in plant community composition within a site could drive composition of the mycorrhizal community.
12071	2148799664	For both EM and AM fungi, there is evidence that, when the fungi are colonizing host plant root systems, competitive (Pearson et al. 1993 ;  Kennedy et al. 2007 ) or facilitative (van Tuinen et al. 1998) interactions can occur between different mycorrhizal species.
12071	2150335363	Numerous studies have shown that both EM and AM fungi show varying levels of host-specificity or host preference for different plant species (Molina and Trappe 1982 ; Bever et al. 1996 ;  Massicotte et al. 1999 ;  Vandenkoornhuyse et al. 2003) .

18289	1973853538	According to Palladini et al,[3] survival in patients with light chain (primary or AL) amyloidosis is best predicted by the combination of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) at presentation and changes in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) after chemotherapy.

18289	1982430370	[2] These strategies are in early investigative stages, and the only available therapies in the clinic result in reduction of the precursor light chain protein supply, which leads to synthesis of the amyloid fibril.
18289	1984419711	[14] The high treatment-related mortality reported in these studies is a major concern.
18289	1994394328	[24] The maximum tolerated dose was 300 mg.
18289	1995859732	[25] The median time on therapy was only 72 days.
18289	2008608243	[20] A second report using parenteral melphalan with dexamethasone in 61 patients reported a median survival of 17.

18289	2030932774	[11] Refinement of patient selection is critical to ensure optimal outcomes.
18289	2037490796	[38] Among patients with primary amyloidosis, worsening of kidney function occurs frequently during lenalidomide therapy, and kidney function needs to be carefully monitored during therapy.
18289	2039282816	[28] Seventy-five patients with advanced amyloidosis were treated.
18289	2039607042	[42] A hematologic response was seen in 94%, and 44% had a complete hematologic response.
18289	2041167176	[26] A hematologic response was seen in 48%, with 26% having organ responses.
18289	2042657558	[30] In the first phase II trial, 34 patients received 25 mg/d, which was poorly tolerated and was reduced to 15 mg/d.
18289	2042839483	It is clear from these studies[15,16] that transplantation in high-risk patients should not be undertaken, but an important question is still whether a more carefully selected cohort benefits from stem cell transplantation; we believe that the answer is yes, pending further trials.

18289	2047948719	This equilibrium between a soluble precursor and an insoluble end product (the fibril) can be impacted by destabilizing the amyloid fibril protein, and research is under way to cause fibril dissolution, by interfering with binding of the amyloid P component or via antibodies against the fibril itself,[1] that leads to shrinkage of amyloid tumors.
18289	2054091101	[37] Type B natriuretic peptide (BNP) increased by more than 30% in a substantial proportion of patients with primary amyloidosis during treatment with lenalidomide.
18289	2069078219	[17] Continuous oral low-dose melphalan provides palliation, although the response rates are low.
18289	2069972656	[18] In a seminal paper with 5 years of follow-up, outcomes in 46 patients ineligible for stem cell transplantation were reported, with organ responses in 48%, a 6-year actuarial survival rate of 50%, and a progression-free survival rate of 40%; the median overall survival time was 5.

20960	1956559956	The basis for the ‚Äúbag of words,‚Äù or vector, model, is the representation of a document by a set of terms (Salton and McGill, 1983).
20960	1956559956	The effectiveness of a retrieval system is commonly measured by the precision and recall of queries run against the system, where precision measures the proportion of relevant documents present in the retrieval set for a query, and recall measures the proportion of relevant documents in the collection that were retrieved by the search (Salton and McGill, 1983).
20960	1956559956	Significant parts are extracted from the documents retrieved by the user‚Äôs query, and the user is asked to indicate each part‚Äôs relevance to their requirements (Salton and McGill, 1983).
20960	1956559956	A collection-specific thesaurus can be constructed automatically, most commonly by detecting related terms through their co-incidence in document pairs (Salton and McGill, 1983).
20960	1989615186	A number of prototype neural network based IR systems have been tested, with most based on the model depicted in Figure 1 (Belew, 1989; Crouch et al. , 1994; Jennings and Higuchi, 1992;  Kwok, 1989, 1991;  Pannu and Sycara, 1996; Wilkinson and Hingston, 1991, 1992; Wong and Cai, 1993). Kwok (1989, 1991)  suggests a similar neural network architecture for using relevance feedback to improve ranking by modifying document connections.
20960	1991848143	An alternative, neural network-based approach to unsupervised clustering is the Self-Organising Map (SOM) method, based on the Kohonen feature map algorithm ( Kohonen 1989, 1995 ).The weights self-organise through the following iterative learning process ( Kohonen, 1989 ):

20960	2028342611	Finally, each training document is mapped to a single node‚Äî either through a simple matching of grid vectors to document vectors ( Lin, et al., 1991 ), or by running an additional pass of the SOM algorithm to self-organise a mapping (Honkela, et al., 1996). Lin, et al., (1991)  demonstrate this by constructing an SOM for AI documents drawn from the LISA (Library and Information Science Abstracts) database.Figure 5.

20960	2086253379	The inference network architecture can also be used to address the collection fusion problem (Callan et al., 1995), which arises when a single query is run against several separate collections.

21668	52962518	It is thus possible that therapeutic effects of CFA on PIA may be associated with the immune regulatory effects of NO by inhibiting macrophage Ia expression, T cell expansion (29) and neutrophil migration ( 30 ), down-regulating expression of selectins, VCAM, and ICAM-1 (31), and stimulating the cytokine-mediated release of corticosterone factor with resultant production of corticosterone (32).

21723	56554895	The taxonomy of tortoises previously included in the genus Geochelone (e.g., Iverson 1992) has recently undergone major taxonomic revision, principally because of the recognition that it is paraphyletic (Bour 1980, 1984, 1985; Crumly 1982, 1984;  Gaffney and Meylan 1988;  Caccone et al. 1999; Gerlach 2001; Palkovacs et al. 2002; Le et al. 2006; Fritz and Bininda-Emonds 2007).
21723	120222612	This is consistent with sedimentological evidence that indicates that deposition at Laetoli was primarily subaerial, and that permanent sources of water, such as rivers or lakes, were absent ( Ditchfield and Harrison 2011 ).
21723	158068872	Skeletal remains of tortoises are comparatively common in the Lower Laetolil Beds at Kakesio, and fossil eggs have been recovered from Kakesio, Lobileita, Esere and Emboremony (see  Harrison and Kweka 2011 ).

21723	1972873587	These are much larger (the maximum length is 70% greater) and more spherical (length:breadth ratio = 1.16) than the eggs of S. brachygularis from Laetoli, being closely comparable in size to those of extant Chelonoidis nigra, the giant tortoise from the Galapagos Islands, which can attain a SCL in excess of 1 m. Similar reports of fossil and subfossil eggs from the Seychelles have been published ( Fryer 1911;  Honegger 1966; Burleigh and ...
21723	2006576376	Egg width in tortoises is positively correlated with body size (Congdon and Tinkle 1982; Congdon and Gibbons 1985;  Hailey and Loumbourdis 1988 ), and appears to be constrained by the diameter of the pelvic canal.
21723	2031200335	By comparison, predation rates are much higher in the smaller African hingeback tortoise (Kinixys spekii), with a maximum carapace length of less than 20 cm, in which 77‚Äì89% of dead tortoises show evidence of predator damage ( Coulson and Hailey 2001 ).
21723	2035682383	Based on these observations, it is tempting to infer a direct relationship between the extinction of giant tortoises in Africa with the appearance of early Homo and stone tool using behaviors (~ 2.3‚Äì2.6 Ma) ( Kimbel et al. 1996;  Semaw et al. 2003).

Exploiting these dierent sources of biological information is quite a complex task so scientists developed several tools for manipulating them or integrate them into more complex databases [9], [ 10 ].
21951	2056898645	Then, a variability measure, as fold change or t statistic or f score [ 16 ] is used to build a sorted list of gene-ranks based on expression profiles.From the beginning of gene expression technologies, clustering algorithms were focused on grouping gene expression profiles with biological conditions [ 16 ].

21951	2082503527	Between the most common methods, we can mention: hierarchical clustering, k-means, Diana, Agnes, Fanny [22], model-based clustering [ 23 ] support vector machines SVM, self organizing maps (SOM), and even association rules (see more details in [24]).
21951	2083175946	Nowadays, one of the main challenges in gene expression technologies is to highlight the main co-expressed1 and co-annotated2 gene groups using at least one of the dierent sources of biological information [ 1 ].structured and controlled vocabularies are one of the best available sources of information to analyze microarray data in order to discover meaningful rules and patterns [ 1 ].
